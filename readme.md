# My Portfolio Website

This website reflects my growth over time and highlights a selection of my previous projects.

This site is designed as a static platform for simplicity, but its data and components are structured to allow for easy adaptation to pull from a database if needed.

I acknowledge that the lack of testing in this repository does not reflect my usual standards. However, given the low criticality of this pageâ€™s functionality, testing was deprioritized. Ideally, I strive to ensure that every component has a corresponding test as a minimum standard.
