            My interest in architecture began in high school when I took a drafting
            class, but it truly solidified at Texas A&M University, where I developed a
            strong passion for Healthcare Design. This focus ultimately guided my career
            path as an officer in the Air Force.

            I always joked that I could save lives without ever having to encounter
            blood, simply through thoughtfully researched and well-designed healthcare
            facilities. Over the course of my career, I&apos;ve worked on a variety of
            projects—from small-scale new constructions to major renovations—and have
            witnessed the profound impact these spaces have on patients, staff, and
            families alike.

            I believe this passion for prioritizing the well-being of others will remain
            a guiding force in any field I pursue.
