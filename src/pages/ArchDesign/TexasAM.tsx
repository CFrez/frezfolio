                    The Bachelor of Environmental Design degree is a four-year pre-professional curriculum that prepares
                    students for graduate study in architecture. The degree is designed to provide a broad
                    foundation for understanding the built environment. Below is my portfolio that I created to showcase
                    work from the degree.
