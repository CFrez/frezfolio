            Architectural Engineering has captivated my interest due to its inherent
            value and practical applications, especially given my residence in a
            century-old house. During the pursuit of this Master&apos;s degree, I had
            the opportunity to delve into the realm of this field and explore a range of
            scientific programming languages and tools. These included Ansys, Matlab,
            LabVIEW, Jupyter, and Python, enabling me to conduct experiments and
            analysis with versatility and precision.
