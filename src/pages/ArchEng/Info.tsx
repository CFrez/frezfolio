            Architectural Engineering has captivated me for its practical applications
            and significant value, especially as someone living in a century-old home.
            While I never intended to pursue it as a career, I thoroughly enjoyed
            learning the foundational principles and practices of the field.

            During the pursuit of this Master&apos;s degree, I had the chance to explore
            this field deeply and explore a range of scientific programming languages
            and tools. These included Ansys, Matlab, LabVIEW, Jupyter, and Python. This
            furthered my interest in software development and data analysis.
