            No matter the situation, I always seem to find a way to design something. My
            projects span a wide rangeâ€”from graphics for businesses to kids&apos;
            Halloween costumes, and even a panel saw crafted from printed parts,
            unistrut, and conduit. You never know what kinds of creative designs
            you&apos;ll discover here!

            Although most of my miscellaneous designs are small projects around the
            house, I always aim to share them. If they&apos;re helpful to me, they could
            also benefit someone else.
