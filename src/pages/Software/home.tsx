                creating intuitive designs. Every part of the process is a chance to
                grow and keep learning.

                    RecipEZ is an innovative recipe app that incorporates the concept of
                    version control. Although still a work in progress, the app aims to
                    empower users to create and modify recipes while preserving the
                    original version. This feature proves particularly valuable for
                    recipes that undergo constant refinement and adjustment. By
                    leveraging version control capabilities, RecipEZ ensures that users
                    can experiment, make changes, and fine-tune their recipes without
                    the risk of losing the initial version. The app's ultimate goal is
                    to provide a seamless and intuitive platform for culinary
                    enthusiasts to create and manage their recipes with flexibility and
                    confidence.
